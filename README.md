# SimpleGnomeAPI
This repo contains all the code i used to get data for a bulk analysis of 800 variants. 
The code is written in python. 
Uses the Gnomad VCF file thats hosted on AWS, and the Gnomad API to get the data.
Please note that the code is not optimized for speed, and is not meant to be used for large scale analysis.
it takes a long time and needs to be run in a Linux environment.

Pysam Version needs to be specified as pysam==0.20.0
